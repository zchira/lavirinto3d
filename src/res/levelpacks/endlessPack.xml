	<startstory>
		Unlimited levels. No end.
		You are so tiny and meaningless...
		Like tears in the rain.
		You may have some small victories,
		but at the end you can't win.
		You'll die.
		Or abandon the game (which is the same).
		It is like in the real life.
		There is no heaven.
		But it may be fun.
		So, cheers :)
